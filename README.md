# Hi, I'm Carly! 👩🏽‍💻 

I'm a software engineer with a passion for mission-driven, full-stack development. I love tracking down tricky bugs -- there's nothing better than collaborating with a great team to get to the bottom of an engineering problem! 🐛

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: An AI-powered, microservices-based platform for monitoring and managing Kubernetes clusters. 
- 🌱 I’m learning: Go, gRPC 
- 💬 Ask me about: React/Redux, TDD, Node/Express, SQL/NoSQL
- 📫 How to reach me: hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlytjackson/) or feel free to [send me an email](mailto:ctjackson5@gmail.com)! 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love Brazilian music -- I am a beginner samba dancer! 💃🏽

## 🚀 Featured Projects
In addition to my work on internal and external tools at CSEngineering, here are some of the projects I’m most proud of:
- [ReacType](https://github.com/open-source-labs/ReacType) – React prototyping app exporting components in TypeScript, developed under tech accelerator OSLabs
- [ReacType landing page](https://github.com/team-reactype/team-reactype.github.io)
- [KubeJedi](https://github.com/carlyjackson/kubejedi) – In progress! Ask questions in natural language, and KubeJedi will explain failures, metrics, logs, and events in plain English.
